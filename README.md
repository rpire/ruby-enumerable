# Ruby Enumerables

> This is a project from the second week of the fourth module of the Microverse Program.

In this project we learned hot to use a module inside a class in Ruby. For this, we created a class `MyList` and a module `MyEnumerable`. The `MyEnumerable` module implements the following methods:
- #all?
- #any?
- #filter

> The `MyList` class and the `MyEnumerable` module are in different `.rb` files.

## Getting Started

- Make sure you have `Ruby` installed in your system. You can install it [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/
).

- Clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/rpire/ruby-enumerable` in your command line.

- Navigate to the repository by running `cd ruby-enumerable`.

- Run the project by running `ruby my_list.rb` on the command line. The program will prompt for a message in morse code and will return a decoded message in full uppercase.

## Optional

- Run `bundle install` to install the `Ruby Gems` including `Rubocop`.
